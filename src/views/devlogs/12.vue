          <p>DPA: Using DNS server is impossible for redirecting regular server requests, but it is possible to use it to change the ELUA. It is better to instead change the IP address of the server inside of the eboot.bin file to redirect the requests to Mirage.</p>

          <p>In order to make a custom launcher you will have to modify the .psarc files, and then modify the checksum in the eboot.bin. We do not have the information for where exactly to find the address of the checksum in the eboot.bin, and without it, all of the .psarc modifications will be rejected. We are not planning to continue the custom launcher, because of this reason. Our rom hacker does not have enough resources to work on the custom launcher.</p>

                    We have utilized PSArcTool to generate a customized  .psarc file. Following the creation process, the VitaShell correctly identified and processed the file. Preliminary observations indicate that the newly generated file employs ZLIB compression methodology, mirroring the characteristics of the standard  .psarc files commonly found in Killzone Mercenary.

                    The effort to modify the .psarc file through rePatch and subsequent application of changes to the targeted game resulted in an unanticipated outcome â€“ the game experienced a crash upon execution. Upon repeated attempts, it was discovered that the root cause lay with PSArcTool itself. Employing Total Commander in conjunction with its psarc plugin allowed for the creation of an altered file which successfully bypassed the original crashing issue. Nevertheless, a new challenge arose: the applied modifications were altogether ignored by the game, rendering them ineffective.

                  We attempted to modify the version of psarc and the aspect ratio, but neither change resolved the issue where the game ignores our custom .psarc file. The aspect ratio setting altered the file size.
