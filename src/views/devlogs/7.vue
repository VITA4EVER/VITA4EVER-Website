      <h3>The NonCriticalGate procedure is tasked with an evaluation based on two parameters: event and dialog. It discerns the current connection type; where the connection type equals 0, the Login function is invoked. Conversely, if the connection type equates to 1, it ascertains the user's authentication statusâ€”if unauthenticated, it prompts the user for login credentials. Absent any qualifying conditions, the procedure transitions to the subsequent interface.</h3>

      <h3>The LoginDataChangedCallback function is a callback method designed to handle changes in login data within a network-based application. This function is triggered when there are updates to the login data, which could be due to various reasons such as changes in connection status, login errors, or successful login attempts. The function is crucial for managing the application's response to these changes, ensuring that the user interface and application state are updated accordingly.<br>

        The function begins by calling UpdateState(), which presumably updates the global variables representing the current state of the network connection, login status, and server login status. This is a common practice in event-driven programming, where the state of the application is frequently updated in response to external events or changes in data.<br>
        
        Next, the function checks for specific error conditions related to the network connection, login process, and server login process. These conditions are represented by the variables gConnectionState, gNPLoginState, gServerLoginState, and gRequestLoginState, which are compared against predefined error codes such as kNetConnectionError, kNpLoginError, kServerLoginError, and kRequestError. If any of these conditions are met, it indicates that an error has occurred during the login process.<br>
        
        Upon detecting an error, the function retrieves the error code from the login data using gLoginTag:GetData("requeststatenode/error_code/text()"). This error code is then used to determine the specific type of error that occurred. Depending on the error code, the function may display a dialog to the user with an appropriate error message and then return to a fallback screen. This is done using the gMenu:DoAction method, which presumably triggers a user interface action such as displaying a dialog.<br>
        
        If the login process is successful (i.e., gRequestLoginState is kRequestComplete and gCancelled is false), the function proceeds to handle the successful login. This includes displaying a success dialog and proceeding to the next screen in the application. If the login process is still in progress (e.g., logging into the server), the function displays a connecting dialog to inform the user of the ongoing process.</h3>

      <h3>The LoginDataChangedCallback function is a callback method that updates the application's state based on changes in login data. It checks for various error conditions related to network connection, login process, and server login process. If an error is detected, it displays an appropriate error dialog to the user and returns to a fallback screen. If the login is successful, it proceeds to the next screen</h3>

      <h3>CancelConnectKZVServer function is a comprehensive handler for cancelling a connection attempt to a KZV server. It ensures that the application's state is correctly updated to reflect the cancellation, logs the action for debugging purposes, and navigates the user to a fallback screen to maintain a smooth user experience.</h3>

      <div style="text-align: center;">
        <img src="@/assets/devlogpictures/7-20.png" style="width:90%; height:90%;">
      </div>]

      <h3>The ConnectedKZVServer function is a handler for a successful connection to a KZV server. It marks the event as handled, retrieves the identifier of the next screen to be displayed after a successful connection, and then proceeds to that screen. This function ensures that the application smoothly transitions to the appropriate screen following a successful server connection.</h3>

      <div style="text-align: center;">
        <img src="@/assets/devlogpictures/7-21.png" style="width:90%; height:90%;">
      </div>

      <h3>The NonCriticalConnectKZVServer function is designed to handle the process of attempting to connect to a server in a non-critical manner. It takes an event e as an argument, which is presumably triggered by some user action or system event related to connecting to a server. In summary, this function is responsible for handling the process of attempting to connect to a server in a non-critical manner, deciding whether to proceed with the login process or to fallback to a different screen based on the success of the connection attempt.</h3>

      <div style="text-align: center;">
        <img src="@/assets/devlogpictures/7-22.png" style="width:90%; height:90%;">

      <h3>The CriticalConnectKZVServer function is designed to handle the connection process to a server in a critical scenario. It takes an event e as an argument, which is expected to contain information about the connection attempt. In summary, this function is a critical part of the network connection logic, handling both successful and unsuccessful connection attempts by either proceeding to the login process or falling back to a predefined screen, respectively.</h3>

      <div style="text-align: center;">
        <img src="@/assets/devlogpictures/7-23.png" style="width:90%; height:90%;">

      <h3>The Proceed function is designed to handle the transition between different screens within a game interface. It takes a single argument, screen, which represents the identifier of the screen to which the game should proceed. In summary, the Proceed function is responsible for managing screen transitions within the game interface, ensuring that the game exits the login gate and proceeds to the specified screen if it's different from the current one, while also handling the case where the game is already on the target screen.</h3>

      <div style="text-align: center;">
        <img src="@/assets/devlogpictures/7-25.png" style="width:90%; height:90%;">
      </div>

      <h3>The ConnectionPreferences function is designed to handle the user's choice regarding network connection preferences within a game interface. It takes an event e as an argument, which is expected to contain information about the user's selection from a set of options. The function then retrieves the value of the selected option, which can be "auto", "always", or "never", and assigns a corresponding integer value to connectionType. Based on this value, the function sets the connection type in the game's player settings, saves these settings, and triggers a non-critical gate action in the game's menu system. This action likely involves displaying a dialog or performing a check related to the network connection preference set by the user.</h3>
